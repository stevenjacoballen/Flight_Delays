# Flight_Delays_ML
Utilizing Machine Learning to Detect Flight Delays
Research Question
How accurately (via recall) can flight delays be predicted using airline performance and weather data?

Project Outline
Import and Clean Data: Two datasets consisting of airline performance, and weather data.
PostgreSQL Database: Create database from the cleaned datasets above, and then query database for finalized project dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis.
Machine Learning: Scale data and train the two following models for binary classification (delayed flight or not delayed). Both models will undergo hyperparameter tuning and will have run-times and performance tracked.
Logistic Regression
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Principal Component Analysis: Conduct PCA on data set to reduce dimensionality and ideally, increase model performance/efficiency.
Retrain Models: Retrain both models above using the optimally tuned hyperparameters.
Results, Observations, Conclusion.
