# Flight_Delays

## Research Question

How accurately (via recall) can flight delays be predicted using airline performance and weather data?



### **Project Outline**
1.	**Import and Clean Data:** Two datasets consisting of airline performance data and weather data.
2.	**PostgreSQL Database:** Create a database from the cleaned datasets and then query database for finalized project dataset.
3.	**Exploratory Data Analysis**
4.	**Machine Learning:** Train the following models with default parameters. Select optimal model based on accuracy score.
 + Logistic Regression Classifier
 + Gradient Boosting Classifier
 + Random Forest Classifier
 + Support Vector Classifier 
5.	**Principal Component Analysis:** Conduct PCA and train optimal model on reduced dataset.
6.	**Hypterparamer Tuning:** Use GridSearch to tune optimal model.
7.	**Conclusion:** Evaluate baseline, tuned, post_PCA, and tuned + post_pca performance for the optimal model.
